    "I came across an interesting way to setup mock objects the other day in python. I was trying to mock out a call to the database. I always have difficulties mocking context managers, because I so often forget that it is the ``return_value`` of ``__enter__`` that needs to be patched. Anyway the code that I was trying to mock looked something like this."

    "However this is really cumbersome, error prone and easy to forget. However because of the way ``Mock`` and ``MagicMock`` work (by creating new child mocks for attributes as they are accessed if they don't already exist) we can just invoke the functions in ``with`` blocks until we get to the call to ``fetchone``. The dummy value still needs to be assigned to the ``return_value`` of ``fetchone`` like before. However this time without chaining all those ``__enter__`` and ``return_value``'s. When the function under test is invoked the ``call`` en ``__enter__`` mocks already exist, and are used by the code under test. I reckon this much more readable."
