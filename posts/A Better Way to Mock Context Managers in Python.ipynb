    "I came across an interesting way to setup mock objects the other day in python. I was trying to mock out a call to the database. I always have difficulties mocking context managers, because I so often forget that it is the ``return_value`` of ``__enter__`` that needs to be patched. Anyway the code that I was trying to mock looked something like this."

    "However this is really cumbersome, error prone and easy to forget. However because of the way ``Mock`` and ``MagicMock`` work (by creating accessed attributes as new child mocks if the attribute doesn't exist) we can just invoke the functions in ``with`` blocks and the setup code is automatically generated. When the function under test is invoked the attributes will already exist, and the mock objects I already set up are used by the code under test. This is much more readable than the chaining of multiple ``return_value`` and ``__enter__``."
